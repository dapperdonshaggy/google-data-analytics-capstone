# Act

The final phase of the data analysis process involves implementing actions based on the insights derived from the analysis. In this context, actionable steps have been formulated in the form of recommendations for the Cyclistic team, stemming from the initial project questions outlined below.

### Questions and Recommendations:

#### 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

   a. On average, Casual Members tend to opt for longer rides on Saturdays, while Annual members show a preference for Thursdays.

   b. Casual Members exhibit a preference for nighttime rides, whereas Annual Members favor mornings.

   c. Both Casual and Annual Members favor classic bikes, though Casual Members seem more inclined to experiment with electric bikes, indicating a less pronounced preference compared to Annual Members.

#### 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

   - While the provided data might not comprehensively address this question, potential benefits influencing casual riders to switch to Annual Memberships could include:
   
     a. Unlimited rides within a 24-hour period.
   
     b. Discounted ride rates based on peak periods such as months, days, or specific times of the day.

#### 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

   a. **Digital Surveys:** Implement surveys at the end of each ride to gather qualitative data on bicycle choices and trip purposes. Offer casual riders a glimpse of potential savings with an Annual Membership and provide a discount code for their initial year.

   b. **Targeted Digital Media Campaigns:** Leverage insights from the analysis, focusing on peak periods for casual riders. Offer discounted Annual Memberships during these peak periods to attract attention and encourage the switch.

   c. **Referral Campaigns:** Target existing Annual Members with referral incentives. If an existing member persuades a casual rider to switch:
   
      - The existing member receives a percentage discount on renewal for each converted casual rider.
   
      - The casual rider gets a discount on their new Annual Membership at sign-up.

These recommendations aim to capitalize on identified usage patterns and preferences, providing a strategic approach for Cyclistic to enhance user engagement and promote the transition from casual to annual memberships.
